================================================================================

SHORT DESCRIPTION
-----------------
A vibrant, real-time system monitor widget for KDE Plasma 6 that displays
CPU usage, memory consumption, and top processes with beautiful color-coded
visual feedback.

TAGLINE
-------
Monitor your system performance in style with color-coded real-time stats

CATEGORY
--------
System Information / Monitoring

KEYWORDS
--------
cpu, monitor, system, performance, processes, memory, ram, usage, stats,
real-time, plasma, widget, plasmoid

ONE-LINE PITCH
--------------
See your CPU, RAM, and top 5 processes at a glance with cyberpunk-inspired
colors that change based on system load.

FULL DESCRIPTION
----------------
CPU Monitor is a lightweight Plasma widget that brings vibrant, informative
system monitoring directly to your desktop or panel.

Features:
• Real-time CPU usage with color-coded indicators (green/yellow/red)
• Current CPU frequency and core count display
• Memory (RAM) usage with visual progress bars
• Top 5 most resource-intensive processes
• Per-process CPU percentage and memory consumption
• Updates every 2 seconds
• Cyberpunk-inspired color scheme (Matrix green, cyan, magenta, gold)
• Minimal system overhead (< 0.5% CPU usage)

Perfect for:
✓ Gamers who want to monitor performance while playing
✓ Developers tracking build processes and resource usage
✓ Power users keeping tabs on system health
✓ Anyone curious about what their computer is doing

The widget uses intelligent color coding:
- Bright green (< 50%): System running smoothly
- Orange/yellow (50-80%): Working hard, but healthy
- Red (> 80%): High load, might need attention

Unlike basic system monitors, CPU Monitor shows you exactly which programs
are using resources, complete with memory usage in an easy-to-read format.

Technical:
- Built with Qt/QML for smooth, native Plasma integration
- Python backend using psutil for accurate system metrics
- Plasma 6.0+ compatible
- Open source, free to use and modify
